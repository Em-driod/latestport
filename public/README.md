This is the public/ directory.

Place static assets here (images, favicons, fonts).

Examples (file paths relative to this folder):
- portrait.jpg  -> referenced in code as "/portrait.jpg"
- logo.png      -> referenced in code as "/logo.png"

In your project, the Hero component currently expects:
- /portrait.jpg

The Navbar currently expects:
- /logo.png

You can replace these with your own files. After adding them, restart the dev server if they're not picked up immediately.
